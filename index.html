    <h2>1. Initial Scenario and Context</h2>
    
    <button class="collapsible">Vipul asked: Initial scenario description and concerns</button>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="prompt">
            <p>suggest me how to proceed and what are my options in the following scenario maintaining righteousness and dignity by drawing a boundary line walk away from potential threat to my property.</p>

            <p>i am moving away from agriculturist role to retirement from agriculturist role as farmer community remains at the lowest in the food chain in existing indian government the least important and yet 65% of the economy of india but neglected community. i am venturing out to explore better postures and looking at managing money by selling farmland and get in the tax paying system rather than being in tax free income as farmer (exploited year after year system).</p>
            
            <p>twist in scenario begins with a call from a friend one day who was passing by my village and wanted to visit my farms as he knew i am interested in selling the farmland he is a lawyer himself by profession in high court in haryana, punjab chandigarh India.</p>

            <p>he looks at the farms this wheat season as wheat crop grows at the farms. and on his way back home calls me to file a suit of taqseem, [land partition from shareholding ownership type to independent landshare].</p>

            <p>i liked the idea of changing the status of land ownership and upgrade the land document. that gives me a chance to sell land at better price and opportunities to setup any industry too with government programs for farmers like pmegp.</p>

            <p>he then introduces me to a retd. tehsildar from my tehsil wayback in 2015-16 he is the same guy who bought his house in kurukshetra where i live in same city. and asked me to discuss the property documents with him and he will suggest the course of action to proceed with land partition. so i did that exactly called him and fixed an appointment to meet and discuss. same day this retired tahsildar enthusiastically offered to visit the farms same day. on ground zero at the portion i want to sell. till this time i was unaware of forces in play at that moment in time as i did not see the actual intention at play on the contrary i was of the view gratefully universe is coming to my help it still is in the form of you as a tool for me to look deeply at what i am getting at. so after that visit it was time to how to initiate the process even though before this i had a buyer who was interested in buying the land as is basis without land partition as this was my intent to upgrade land papers.</p>

            <p>now tehsildar suggested a lawyer in my tehsil under kurukshetra district in pehowa court. i was still in the impression that whatever is happening is happening for good [belief set]. still not seeing the forces at play clearly(human conditioning in present).
            so the lawyer friend: Naveen bansal > recommends retd. tehsildar: desraj Mangla> sumit garg [advocate in pehowa tehsil, who is dealing with taqseem process resident of my village].</p>

            <p>slowly the perception started to shift towards doubting the intention of the advocate sumit garg as in first meeting i gave him 5k inr as advance transferred the amount to his upi connected mobile number with his bank account upon asking what will be his fee? advocate said desraj ji will decide how much his fee will be. so mean time client advocate contract is signed keeping fee column empty. i took me four days to get hold of desraj to discuss the fee matter and after careful calculation tehsildar desraj said pay him 55k of which i had paid him 5k in advance therefore balance is 50k. same is communicated to sumit garg in pehowa. lawyer at ground zero is part of the network of naveen bansal(rich guy, well off)[received the inheritance of 50cr from his father plus some high value property in panchkula, he used to live where desraj lives now in kurukshetra shifted to panchkula district 5 years ago.</p>

            <p>my perspective as of today is that i cannot trust anyone and mind throws lot of scenarios to confuse me and not look at as things are maybe ego is at play of losing control over me, as i am acting on complete free will. fear is natural to arise i understand the mechanics of human conditioning. it is generating perceptions or projections that are relevant to the situation. thing i am looking at is people become merciless when they find a target that is weaker than them and that they can over power them with their capabilities and network strengths of like minded people who re looking for money by making the prey defenseless and then hunt them down to extract or buy their property at cheaper rates and then sell for profit [key intent at play which is the source of my anxiety] .or is it just my plain imagination.</p>

            <p>16th april is the day when summons to the shareholders of joint ownership in that khewat will be informed about my intent to partition the land. and that they have no objection and 1. sign the summons. 2. those who don't or they have a rivalry with me or my ancestors will not sign it. and the game plan progresses from here. now sumit has a situation to linger on with and in the meantime if this news is leaked the property which is now selling at 60 lacs per acre. might come down or seen as disputed.
            question is i do not want to be in position to sell it in distress as i have to compromise the price with buyer. right?</p>

            <p>the control of selling goes to naveen bansal and desraj and sumit garg to decide the price and their share on their terms.</p>
            
            <p>Questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>should i discuss the matter directly with naveen or his network now. will it alert them if i do and give them time to strategise their next move and blackmail me in some way?</li>
                <li>what is best course of action now?</li>
                <li>will ask more questions after your response to this scenario as i could download from my error some memory[might have missed a few detail in process of typing the scenario]. will add the details as i recall during this conversation with you.</li>

            <h3>Understanding Your Land Sale Situation</h3>

            <p>Thank you for sharing this detailed situation regarding your farmland and the potential concerns you have about the people involved in the land partition process. I understand your anxiety about protecting your property interests while maintaining your dignity and ethical standards.</p>

            <h4>Analysis of Your Situation</h4>

            <p>What I see happening is a potential network forming around your land transaction:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Your lawyer friend Naveen Bansal initiated this process, suggesting the taqseem (land partition)</li>
                <li>He connected you with retired tehsildar Desraj Mangla, who now lives in Naveen's former house</li>
                <li>Desraj directed you to advocate Sumit Garg from your village</li>
                <li>Fee arrangements were unusual - you paid 5K initially with the final amount (55K) decided later by Desraj rather than clear upfront pricing</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Your concern about losing control of the selling process is valid. The pattern suggests these individuals may have established relationships that could potentially work against your interests.</p>

            <h4>Recommended Course of Action</h4>

            <p>Here's what I recommend:</p>

            <h5>1. Secure independent legal counsel immediately</h5>
            <p>Find a reputable property lawyer unconnected to this network, preferably from a different area than Pehowa but familiar with Haryana property laws. This independent lawyer can review all documents you've signed and advise on your position.</p>

            <h5>2. Document everything</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a detailed timeline of all interactions, including dates, who was present, what was discussed</li>
                <li>Save all communications (messages, emails)</li>
                <li>Note all payments made and promised</li>
                <li>Record any unusual behavior or statements that caused concern</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>3. Regarding direct confrontation</h5>
            <p>I would not recommend directly confronting Naveen about your suspicions yet. This could indeed alert them and potentially lead to countermeasures if your concerns are valid. Your independent lawyer should guide any communications going forward.</p>

            <h5>4. Consider pausing the process</h5>
            <p>If possible, find a legitimate reason to temporarily pause proceedings until you've secured independent advice. Perhaps cite the need for additional documentation or family consultation.</p>

            <h5>5. Investigate alternate paths to land partition</h5>
            <p>Your independent lawyer can advise whether there are more direct government channels to handle taqseem without requiring this specific group of individuals.</p>

            <h5>6. Protect your documentation</h5>
            <p>Ensure all original property papers remain in your possession. Only provide certified copies when necessary.</p>

            <h4>Long-Term Strategy</h4>

            <ul>
                <li>Consider engaging directly with potential buyers yourself while the legal process continues</li>
                <li>Research current market rates thoroughly so you know the true value of your property</li>
                <li>Connect with local farmer associations who might provide guidance about similar situations</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Remember that maintaining both righteousness and dignity doesn't mean you must be passive. You can be assertive about your rights while remaining ethical and respectful in all dealings.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Concerns About Pausing the Process</h2>
    
    <button class="collapsible">Vipul asked: Challenges with pausing the process</button>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="prompt">
            <p>pausing the process. if i do not pay lawyer process is paused at his end but the court process continues the messenger of summons from court needs to be paid to execute the signatures to co-landsharers in the khewat of the farmland. i will end up having names that are not in my favor of land partitioning. my peace of mind goes out of the window. i lost my most precious element of existence. another lawyer means more expenses which i cannot afford. so thanks but no thanks.</p>

    <button class="collapsible">Alternative strategies without changing lawyers</button>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="response">
            <p>I understand your concerns completely. Pausing the process and hiring another lawyer aren't practical options given your financial constraints and the court proceedings already in motion. The loss of peace of mind is indeed a serious concern.</p>

            <p>Let me suggest some alternative approaches that work within your current situation:</p>

            <h3>Working Within the Current Framework</h3>

            <h4>1. Strategic Engagement with Current Representatives</h4>
            <p>Rather than withdrawing, consider becoming more actively involved in the process while maintaining a cordial relationship with your current representatives:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Request regular updates from Sumit Garg about each step in the process</li>
                <li>Ask to be present for any significant discussions or decisions</li>
                <li>Request copies of all documents filed or received</li>
                <li>Clearly communicate your price expectations for the land in writing</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Direct Involvement with Court Process</h4>
            <p>You can still participate in the court process while working with your current lawyer:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Attend all hearings personally if possible</li>
                <li>Try to be present when the court messenger delivers summons to co-landholders</li>
                <li>Keep detailed notes of all proceedings and responses</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>3. Knowledge Building</h4>
            <p>Information is power in this situation:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Research similar land partition cases in your area to understand typical timelines and outcomes</li>
                <li>Learn about the specific legal requirements for taqseem in Haryana</li>
                <li>Speak with other farmers who have gone through similar processes successfully</li>
                <li>Understand exactly what documents need to be filed and what signatures are required</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>4. Building Supporting Relationships</h4>
            <p>Consider cultivating relationships with:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The local patwari who maintains land records</li>
                <li>Revenue officials at the tehsil office who can verify proper procedures</li>
                <li>Other landowners in your khewat who might share your interests</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>5. Direct Communication with Potential Buyers</h4>
            <p>While the legal process continues:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Maintain contact with your original interested buyer</li>
                <li>Let them know about the partition process as a positive development</li>
                <li>Establish clear expectations about timing and price</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This approach allows you to work within the existing framework while taking steps to protect your interests and maintain as much control as possible over the outcome.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>3. Booking Amount Considerations</h2>
    
    <button class="collapsible">Vipul asked: Should I accept a booking amount?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="prompt">
            <p>should i receive the booking amount from the buyer in this stager. at least that gives me leverage but also allows sumit to expand on his fee and future course or manipulate the proceedings at his and as per the directions from the network chief naveen bansal.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

            <h3>Accepting a Booking Amount: Strategic Analysis</h3>

            <p>Taking a booking amount at this stage presents both opportunities and significant risks that need careful consideration.</p>

            <h4>Potential Benefits</h4>

            <p>A booking amount could provide you with:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Financial security</strong> - Some immediate cash flow during this uncertain process</li>
                <li><strong>Buyer commitment</strong> - It demonstrates serious intent from the buyer</li>
                <li><strong>Market validation</strong> - Proves your land has real market value at your asking price</li>
                <li><strong>Psychological advantage</strong> - May give you increased confidence in negotiations with your legal team</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Significant Risks</h4>

            <p>However, accepting a booking amount now creates several potential complications:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Legal entanglement</strong> - You would be contractually obligated to this buyer, potentially limiting your flexibility during the partition process</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge is leverage</strong> - If Sumit Garg and the network discover you have a committed buyer:
                    <ul>
                        <li>They gain confirmation that your land is valuable and marketable</li>
                        <li>This might incentivize them to increase their fees or extract more value</li>
                        <li>They could intentionally complicate the process to pressure you into paying more</li>
                        <li>They might attempt to communicate directly with your buyer</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Timeline complications</strong> - Most booking agreements include completion timeframes, which may not align with the unpredictable court partition process</li>
                <li><strong>Refund obligations</strong> - If the partition process becomes complicated or prolonged, you might face demands to return the booking amount plus potential penalties</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Balanced Recommendation</h4>

            <p>Given your specific situation, accepting a booking amount at this stage would likely give the lawyer network more leverage than it gives you. The knowledge of a committed buyer would signal your land's value and your intent to sell quickly, which could make you more vulnerable to pressure tactics.</p>

            <p>Instead, consider:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Maintaining buyer interest without formal commitment</strong> - Keep the buyer engaged through regular updates about the partition process, positioning it as adding value to their potential purchase</li>
                <li><strong>Documenting your price expectations</strong> - Create a dated record of your minimum acceptable price before the network potentially attempts to influence your decision</li>
                <li><strong>Focusing on completing the partition first</strong> - Once the legal status of the land is clear, you'll have stronger negotiating position with both buyers and your current legal representation</li>
            </ol>

            <p>If you absolutely need the financial security of a booking amount, consider a very small token amount with explicit written terms that protect your interests during the partition process.</p>

            <h3>Protective Language for Farmland Booking Agreement</h3>

            <p>Below is a template of protective clauses you might include in a booking agreement. These are designed to safeguard your interests during the ongoing partition process. While this provides a starting point, having it reviewed by an independent legal professional would be ideal if possible.</p>

            <h4>Essential Protective Clauses</h4>

            <h5>1. Conditional Nature of Agreement</h5>
            <blockquote>
                "This booking agreement is expressly conditional upon the successful completion of the ongoing land partition (taqseem) process for Khewat No. [number] in [village/location]. The Seller retains full discretion to determine whether the partition has been satisfactorily completed. No transfer of ownership rights shall occur until the partition is finalized and registered."
            </blockquote>

            <h5>2. Timeline Protection</h5>
            <blockquote>
                "While both parties acknowledge the intent to complete this transaction in a timely manner, no specific timeline for completion is guaranteed due to the unpredictable nature of the partition proceedings. This agreement shall remain valid for a period of [X months] from signing, with automatic extensions of [Y months] unless either party provides written notice of termination."
            </blockquote>

            <h5>3. Booking Amount and Refund Terms</h5>
            <blockquote>
                "The booking amount of Rs. [amount] represents [X%] of the full purchase price of Rs. [full amount]. This booking amount is refundable in full to the Buyer under the following circumstances only:
                <ul>
                    <li>If the land partition process is abandoned or fails to complete within [time period]</li>
                    <li>If government restrictions prevent the transfer after partition</li>
                    <li>If the Seller chooses not to sell after partition for any reason, in which case a penalty of [small percentage] shall be added to the refund</li>
                </ul>
                In all other circumstances, should the Buyer choose to withdraw from this agreement, the booking amount shall be forfeited to the Seller as liquidated damages."
            </blockquote>

            <h5>4. Price Protection</h5>
            <blockquote>
                "The full purchase price is hereby fixed at Rs. [amount] per acre for a total of Rs. [total amount] for the entire parcel. This price is non-negotiable and shall not be subject to reduction based on delays in the partition process, changes in market conditions, or representations made by any third parties including but not limited to legal representatives of either party."
            </blockquote>

            <h5>5. Direct Communication Clause</h5>
            <blockquote>
                "Both parties agree to communicate directly with each other regarding all substantive matters related to this transaction. While legal representatives may facilitate the process, no binding modifications to this agreement may be made through third parties without the express written consent of both Buyer and Seller."
            </blockquote>

            <h5>6. Confidentiality Provision</h5>
            <blockquote>
                "The existence, terms, and conditions of this booking agreement shall remain strictly confidential between the parties until the successful completion of the land partition process. Neither party shall disclose this agreement to any third parties except as required by law or to their direct legal counsel who shall be bound by the same confidentiality obligations. Any breach of this confidentiality provision by either party shall be grounds for termination of this agreement at the non-breaching party's discretion."
            </blockquote>

            <h5>7. Non-Interference Clause</h5>
            <blockquote>
                "Both parties agree not to interfere with or attempt to influence the land partition process except through proper legal channels. The Buyer shall not contact or attempt to influence any officials, legal representatives, or other parties involved in the partition process without the Seller's express written permission."
            </blockquote>

            <h5>8. Representation Acknowledgment</h5>
            <blockquote>
                "The Seller acknowledges that they have engaged [Advocate Name] for the limited purpose of facilitating the land partition process. Both parties acknowledge that said advocate does not represent either party in this transaction and has no authority to negotiate, modify, or interpret this booking agreement."
            </blockquote>

            <h5>9. Documentation of Land Condition</h5>
            <blockquote>
                "The land is being booked in its present condition and location. A detailed land description including boundaries, access routes, and current usage is attached as Annexure A. Both parties have inspected the property and agree that this represents the accurate condition of the land at the time of booking."
            </blockquote>

            <h5>10. Dispute Resolution</h5>
            <blockquote>
                "Any disputes arising from this agreement shall be resolved through arbitration in [neutral location outside your immediate district] under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Both parties agree not to file civil suits related to this agreement without first attempting arbitration."
            </blockquote>

            <h4>Using This Agreement</h4>

            <p>When implementing this agreement:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Keep the original with you and provide only a copy to the buyer</li>
                <li>Have it notarized if possible to establish the date of signing</li>
                <li>Consider having a trusted family member as a witness</li>
                <li>Do not disclose the existence of this agreement to your current lawyer network unless absolutely necessary</li>
                <li>Make the booking amount substantial enough to demonstrate serious intent but not so large that its forfeiture would be unduly punitive</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This agreement balances your need for financial security through a booking amount while protecting you from potential manipulation by third parties involved in the partition process.</p>

            <h3>Analysis of Intentions in Your Land Partition Scenario</h3>

            <p>After carefully examining the scenario you've described, I can identify the potential intentions of each party involved. Let me break this down systematically:</p>

            <h4>Your Intentions (The Landowner)</h4>

            <p>Your intentions appear straightforward and legitimate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Transition from agricultural work to retirement</li>
                <li>Convert agricultural assets to more stable financial investments</li>
                <li>Enter the tax-paying system rather than remaining in what you perceive as an "exploited" tax-free farmer category</li>
                <li>Upgrade land documents through partition (taqseem) to increase property value</li>
                <li>Sell at fair market value (60 lacs per acre)</li>
                <li>Potentially use funds for other ventures or investments</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There's no indication of malice in your intentions - just a reasonable desire to maximize the value of your assets while making a life transition.</p>

            <h4>Network Players and Their Potential Intentions</h4>

            <h5>1. Naveen Bansal (Lawyer Friend)</h5>
            <p><strong>Concerning Behaviors:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Coincidentally" visited your village and farms</li>
                <li>Immediately suggested taqseem and created a chain of connections</li>
                <li>Wealthy individual (50 cr inheritance plus high-value property)</li>
                <li>Previously owned the house where Desraj now lives</li>
                <li>Central node connecting all other parties</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Potential Hidden Intentions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating a controlled environment around your land transaction</li>
                <li>Positioning himself to influence the sale price and possibly purchase at below-market value</li>
                <li>Using his established network to execute a sophisticated property acquisition strategy</li>
                <li>Leveraging his wealth and legal knowledge to create an information imbalance</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Malice Likelihood: HIGH</strong> - The orchestrated nature of his involvement and the created network suggests deliberate planning rather than coincidence.</p>

            <h5>2. Desraj Mangla (Retired Tehsildar)</h5>
            <p><strong>Concerning Behaviors:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Lives in Naveen's former house (suggesting close personal relationship)</li>
                <li>"Enthusiastically" volunteered to visit farms immediately</li>
                <li>Set the lawyer's fee (55K) rather than allowing standard market pricing</li>
                <li>Former government official with inside knowledge of land processes</li>
                <li>Acted as the connector to the local advocate</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Potential Hidden Intentions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Using his government experience to identify procedural vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Creating dependency on his "expertise" to navigate the process</li>
                <li>Possibly receiving compensation from both sides (you and potential buyers)</li>
                <li>Acting as Naveen's agent in the process</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Malice Likelihood: HIGH</strong> - His unusual enthusiasm and insertion into the fee structure suggests opportunistic behavior.</p>

            <h5>3. Sumit Garg (Local Advocate)</h5>
            <p><strong>Concerning Behaviors:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accepted payment without clarifying total fees</li>
                <li>Had you sign a contract with an empty fee column</li>
                <li>Deferred fee decisions to Desraj (unusual professional practice)</li>
                <li>Positioned to control the court process timelines</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Potential Hidden Intentions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Creating opportunities to increase fees as the process continues</li>
                <li>Potentially slowing down or complicating the process to create pressure</li>
                <li>Using his local position to influence how summons are delivered and received</li>
                <li>Possibly communicating with other parties about your land without your knowledge</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Malice Likelihood: MEDIUM-HIGH</strong> - While possibly just following the lead of the others, his irregular professional practices suggest active participation.</p>

            <h4>The Likely Scheme</h4>

            <p>Based on the behaviors and relationships described, a potential scheme emerges:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Create a legal process (taqseem) that puts your land in a temporary state of uncertainty</li>
                <li>After April 16th, when summons are delivered, ensure some shareholders object or don't respond</li>
                <li>Allow rumors of "disputed" land to circulate, devaluing the property from 60 lacs per acre</li>
                <li>Increase legal fees as "complications" arise, creating financial pressure</li>
                <li>Have your original buyer withdraw due to delays and complications</li>
                <li>Eventually, someone in their network (or Naveen himself) offers to "solve your problem" by purchasing at a significantly reduced price</li>
                <li>Once they own the land, they efficiently complete the partition and sell at full market value</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This represents a sophisticated land acquisition strategy that leverages legal processes, information asymmetry, and financial pressure to acquire valuable property at below-market rates.</p>

            <h4>Protection Strategy</h4>

            <p>To counter this potential scheme:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Regain control of the timeline - push for immediate action on the summons</li>
                <li>Document all interactions with extreme detail</li>
                <li>Consider having a trusted friend or family member present at all meetings</li>
                <li>Clearly communicate your price expectations in writing</li>
                <li>Maintain contact with your original buyer independently of this network</li>
                <li>Consider seeking guidance from a district-level revenue official who outranks a tehsildar</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The most critical immediate action is maintaining independence in your buyer relationships while not antagonizing the network until you've secured your position.</p>

    <h2>6. Friend's Betrayal Question</h2>

    <button class="collapsible">Analysis of friend's apparent betrayal</button>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="response">
            <p>Based on the information you've shared, there are indeed strong indications that your friend Naveen Bansal may not be acting in your best interests. While I can't know his innermost thoughts with absolute certainty, the pattern of behavior you've described shows several concerning red flags:</p>

            <p>The situation appears carefully orchestrated rather than coincidental. Consider the sequence of events:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Naveen "happened" to be passing by your village</li>
                <li>He immediately suggested a specific legal process (taqseem) after seeing your wheat crop</li>
                <li>He connected you with someone living in his former house (Desraj)</li>
                <li>This led to another connection (Sumit) from your own village</li>
                <li>The unusual fee arrangements where contracts were signed with blank fee columns</li>
                <li>The timing aligns perfectly with potentially creating uncertainty around your property</li>
            </ol>

            <p>These actions follow a pattern that experienced property dealers sometimes use to gain leverage in land transactions. The network of connections seems designed to surround you with people who have pre-existing relationships with each other but not with you.</p>

            <p>What makes this particularly concerning is that a true friend who is also a lawyer would typically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explain all options clearly, including pros and cons</li>
                <li>Recommend transparent fee structures</li>
                <li>Suggest multiple professionals you could work with</li>
                <li>Prioritize your financial interests above others'</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The behavior you've described instead suggests a carefully constructed situation where control of the process and potentially the final price is being shifted away from you and toward this network.</p>

            <p>I understand this must be deeply disappointing if you've trusted Naveen as a friend. People who have known us for years sometimes see opportunities in our life transitions and unfortunately choose self-interest over friendship. The wealth disparity you mentioned (his 50 crore inheritance versus your position as a retiring farmer) makes this power imbalance even more concerning.</p>
