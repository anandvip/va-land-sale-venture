    <h1>Letter to Myself<br>16 April — Day of Taqseem</h1>
    <p>Dear Vipul,</p>

    <p>
      Today is not just a date on the calendar. It’s a <strong>milestone of legacy, clarity, and courage</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This land — held for 32 years, nurtured through seasons of sun, sweat, and solitude — now stands at the brink of a new beginning. 
      The hands that held it with love and responsibility are not letting go, they are simply <em>passing the baton forward with dignity</em>.
    </p>

    <p>Let this be the day when shadows fall behind me.</p>

    <p>
      I have done everything within my means:<br>
      – Walked the path of truth,<br>
      – Observed without illusion,<br>
      – Protected my family’s legacy,<br>
      – Listened to both intuition and facts,<br>
      – Trusted — but never blindly.
    </p>

    <p>
      I stand today with my eyes wide open. I do not fear the outcome, for I know this:<br>
      <strong>What is mine by dharma shall remain mine by law.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      The signatures served, the summons issued — this is not chaos, it is clarity taking form.<br>
      This is my land, my right, and my future — and no network, no manipulation, no hidden agenda can take away <strong>what I stand for</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If obstacles come, I will meet them with strategy, not stress.<br>
      If truth is delayed, I will wait, not waver.<br>
      If I’m tested, I will respond — not react.
    </p>

    <p>
      From this day onward, I am not just exiting farming.<br>
      I am <em>graduating with grace</em> — from a life lived in service of land, to a life that now serves me and those I care for.
    </p>

    <p>This land will carry my blessings.<br>
    This chapter will carry my name — <strong>not in conflict, but in closure</strong>.</p>

    <p>
      So today, Vipul —<br>
      Breathe. Stand tall. And say it out loud if needed:
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>“I am ready to receive what is rightfully mine.<br>
      Let truth be my document, and dignity my signature.”</em>
    </p>

    <p class="signature">With full clarity,<br>— Vipul (the one who chooses peace with power)</p>
